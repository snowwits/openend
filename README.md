# Open End
Chrome extension that hides the duration and title of videos on Twitch.tv to prevent spoilers when watching sports or e-sports videos.

## Description 
When you are watching videos of e-sport or sport events the duration and titles of videos can often give away the ending. For example, if you are watching a best-of-3 series and the video has almost reached its end during second match, you know that it will be a 2:0 victory.
Or if you are scrolling through a video list to find the semifinals videos and accidentally read the finalists names in the grand final video title, the excitement for the semifinals fades away.

Open End prevents those kinds of spoilers by hiding certain information on Twitch.tv. Its features include:

## Features
### Main Feature: Spoiler-Free Mode
- Hides progress and duration of the video you are currently watching
- Hides duration, title and preview of other videos (suggested/related videos, videos in video lists)
- Provides quick video navigation features to mitigate the lack of a seek bar

### Special Features
- Custom channel list to auto-enable the Spoiler-Free Mode only on certain channels
- You can toggle the visibility of any hideable element directly on the page (no need to refresh the page)
- Option changes are directly applied (no need to refresh the page)
- Auto-enter the Theatre Mode

### Limitations
- Currently only Twitch.tv is supported, YouTube.com support is planned
