# Open End
Chrome extension that lets you hide the title, preview and duration of videos on Twitch.tv to prevent spoilers when watching sports or e-sports videos.

## Description 
Sometimes you can't or don't want to watch a sports or e-sports event live. But when you are watching the videos later, the titles, preview thumbnails or durations of videos can often give away the ending. For example, if you are watching a best-of-3 series and the video has almost reached its end during second match, you know that it will be a 2:0 victory.
Or if you are scrolling through a video list to find the semifinals videos and accidentally read the finalists names in the grand final video title, the excitement for the semifinals quickly fades away.

Open End prevents those kinds of spoilers by hiding certain information on Twitch.tv. Its features include:

## Features
### Main Feature: Spoiler-Free Mode
- Hides the progress and duration of the video you are currently watching
- Hides the title, preview and duration of other videos (suggested/related videos, videos in video lists)
- Provides quick video navigation features to mitigate the lack of a seek bar

### Special Features
- Custom channel list to auto-enable the Spoiler-Free Mode only on selected channels (for example enable it on tournament channels but not on streamer channels)
  - Quickly add/remove channels to/from the list without having to go through the options (only two clicks needed)
- What information should be hidden is customizable
- The visibility of any hideable element can be toggled directly on the page (no need to refresh the page)
- Option changes are directly applied (no need to refresh the page)
- Auto-enter the Theatre Mode
