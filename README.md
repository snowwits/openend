## 1. Description 
Sometimes you can't or don't want to watch a e-sports or sports event live. But when you are watching the videos later, the titles, previews or durations of videos can often give away the ending. For example, if you are watching a best-of-3 series and the video has almost reached its end during second match, you know that it will be a 2:0 victory.
Or if you are scrolling through a video list to find the semifinals videos and accidentally read the finalists names in the grand final video title, the excitement for the semifinals quickly fades away.

Open End prevents those kinds of spoilers by hiding certain information on Twitch.tv. Its features include:

## 2. Features
### 2.1 Main Feature: Spoiler-Free Mode
- Hides the progress and duration of the video you are currently watching.
- Hides the title, preview and duration of other videos (suggested/related videos, videos in video lists).
- Provides a Video Navigation Toolbar to mitigate the lack of a seek bar.

### 2.2 Minor Features
- Fine-grained control over on which video platforms or channels the Spoiler-Free Mode should be enabled.
  - For example enable it on tournament channels but not on streamer channels.
  - Enabling/disabling of the Spoiler-Free Mode can be done quickly via the Open End icon.
- What information should be hidden is customizable.
- The visibility of any hideable element can be toggled directly on the page (no need to refresh the page)

## 3. Usage

### 3.1 Overview
- **Open End icon / Popup:** The extension has an icon in the Chrome toolbar (next to the address bar). If you click on it, a popup opens. The icon and the popup have two purposes:
  1. Inform you:
     - Whether the current web page is a supported video platform.
       - On supported platforms the icon is colored, otherwise it is grey.
     - Whether the Spoiler-Free Mode is active on the current web page.
       - When the Spoiler-Free Mode is active, the icon has an "SFM" badge.
     - The current status is also displayed on the popup.
  2. Provide quick access to the most important options. On the popup you can quickly:
     - Enabled/disable the Spoiler-Free Mode vor a video platform or a channel.
       - See [3.2 Enable/Disable the Spoiler-Free Mode](#32-enabledisable-the-spoiler-free-mode).
     - Open the options page.
- **Video Navigation Toolbar:** If the Spoiler-Free Mode is enabled, a Video Navigation Toolbar will be added to the video player because the regular seek bar will be hidden.
  - The toolbar provides:
    - A button to show/hide the seek bar and duration in case you need it.
    - Buttons to quickly navigate in the video without the seek bar.
  - To learn how to navigate in a video, see [3.4 Video Navigation](#34-video-navigation).
  - The toolbar can be configured in the options.
- **Video Lists:** Open End can hide certain information about videos in videos lists to prevent spoilers, such as video title, video preview and video duration.
  - What information is hidden can be customized in the options, see [3.3 Customize the Spoiler-Free Mode](#33-customize-the-spoiler-free-mode).
- **Options:** On the popup you can click on the "Options..." button to open the options of the extension. Feel free to explore the options and customize the extension according to your preferences.

### 3.2 Enable/Disable the Spoiler-Free Mode
There are three layers to give you fine control over where to enable/disable the Spoiler-Free Mode.
1. **Global:** Enable/disable the Spoiler-Free Mode globally. You can choose between:
   - *Never:* Disable the Spoiler-Free Mode globally.
   - *Always:* Enable the Spoiler-Free Mode globally.
   - *Platform-dependent:* Defer the decision to the platform level.
2. **Platform:** Enable/disable the Spoiler-Free mode for a specific video platform. You can choose between:
   - *Never:* Disable the Spoiler-Free Mode on this platform.
   - *Always:* Enable the Spoiler-Free Mode on this platform.
   - *Channel-dependent:* Defer the decision to the channel level.
     - If channels are supported on this platform. For example on Twitch.tv channels are supported, on MLG.com they are not.
3. **Channel:** Enable/disable the Spoiler-Free mode for a specific video channel. You can choose between:
   - *Disable:* Disable the Spoiler-Free Mode on this channel.
   - *Enable:* Enable the Spoiler-Free Mode on this channel.

Settings on higher layers have priority over settings on lower layers.
For example, settings on the platform and channel level only have an effect if the global setting is set to "Platform-dependent".

### 3.4 Video Navigation
