TODO
short term:
- option to hide VOD titles on /videos/all page (maybe show when mouseover or button pressed)
- check periodically no matter if video tiles where already found (because you can navigate to the /videos/all page without leaving the VOD page (player gets minimized into the bottom left corner))
- display error message when user is trying to seek with invalid duration string
- create open end icon
- create "Toggle Progress" icon
- create "Toggle Duration" icon (for /videos/all)
- create "Toggle Title" icon (for /videos/all)
long term:
- support YouTube.com
- find a way to directly access Twitch.Player for seeking instead of reloading the entire page (Twitch.Player isn't accessible)
