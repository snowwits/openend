# Roadmap and Version Notes
## Roadmap (Planned Features)
### Short Term


### Long Term
- Think of a name (maybe not Open End?)
  - Create matching application icon
- YouTube.com support is planned (maybe full MLG.com support, too)
- Quick video navigation currently requires a reload of the page. Further investigation is needed to determine if there is a way that this can be done without having to reload the page (like when you seek normally using the seek bar)

## Version Notes
### Open End 0.x.x (BETA)
- During the Beta phase there will be no version notes
