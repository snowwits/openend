# Roadmap and Version Notes
## Roadmap (Planned Features)
### Short Term


### Long Term
- Think of a name (maybe not Open End?)
  - Create matching application icon
- YouTube.com support is planned (maybe full MLG.com support, too)
- Quick video navigation currently requires a reload of the page. Further investigation is needed to determine if there is a way that this can be done without having to reload the page (like when you seek normally using the seek bar)

## Version Notes

### Open End "0.2.x (BETA)" (2017-12-06)
- Very basic support for MLG.com and OverwatchLeague.com for the Overwatch League Pre-Season matches
  - Hides duration of currently played video and other videos if Spoiler-Free Mode is enabled
  
### Open End "0.1.x (BETA)" (2017-12-05)
- Very first BETA release
