- When watching a VOD where SFM is enabled, then switching on-page to a live channel (e.g. overwatchcontenders VOD -> emongg live stream from the left bar), the Open End Toolbar is not removed
  - So: We need to remove the Toolbar on content_script init
- For MLG.com only SfmEnabled.ALWAYS/NEVER should be available, because no channels are supported on this platform
  - So: Add flag supportsChannels: boolean and use it accordingly
