# Roadmap and Version Notes
## Roadmap (Planned Features)
### Short Term
- Support for hiding other video's titles
  - Including the image alt attribute of the video preview image
- Blacklist / Whitelist support
- Technial: If option value changes, only update page parts that need update
- Create Application icon
- Think of a name (maybe not Open End?)

### Long Term
- Support YouTube.com
- Find a way to directly access Twitch.Player for time jumps instead of reloading the entire page (Twitch.Player isn't accessible)
