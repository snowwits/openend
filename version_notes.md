# Roadmap and Version Notes
## Roadmap (Planned Features)
### Short Term
- Create application icon
- Think of a name (maybe not Open End?)

### Long Term
- YouTube.com support is planned
- Quick video navigation currently requires a reload of the page. Further investigation is needed to determine if there is a way that this can be done without having to reload the page (like when you seek normally using the seek bar)

## Version Notes
### Open End 0.1.0 (BETA)
- Initial version
